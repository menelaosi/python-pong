# python-pong
Testing Chat GPT code generation to demonstrate something basic but I've expanded it a little bit

## Running this
1. Clone this repository from github, download the python file, or just copy it over to your computer somehow
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (might be under python or python3 depending on setup)
3. Run `python3 pong.py` or whatever Python command you have
4. Use `w` and `s` for the left paddles; `up` and `down` for the right paddle

## Next steps
Going to add score-keeping to this if I decide to play with it more.
